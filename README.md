# 📌 Real-Time Chat System using Docker & Kubernetes

🚀 **Technologies Used:**  
- 🐳 **Docker** - Containerization of the WebSocket application  
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** - Orchestrating and managing containerized services  
- ⚡ **WebSockets** - Enabling real-time, bidirectional communication  
- 📂 **YAML** - Kubernetes manifest files for deployment & services  
- 🔀 **Kubernetes Services** - Managing communication between pods  
- 📈 **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** - Scaling based on CPU utilization

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
This project implements a **real-time chat system** using WebSockets, containerized with Docker, and deployed in a **Kubernetes cluster**. It is designed for **scalability** and **fault tolerance**, ensuring real-time message delivery between users.

🔹 **Key Features:**
- Lightweight WebSocket server for real-time chat 🗨️
- Deployed using Kubernetes for auto-scaling and high availability ⚙️
- ClusterIP service for internal communication between pods 🔄
- HPA to scale pods dynamically based on CPU load 📊

## 📌 **Topics Covered**
✅ **Dockerization** - Building & running containerized applications  
✅ **Kubernetes Deployments** - Managing app lifecycle in the cluster  
✅ **Kubernetes Services** - Facilitating communication between pods  
✅ **Scaling Strategies** - Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes HPA  
✅ **Port Forwarding** - Testing WebSocket connectivity in Kubernetes  
✅ **Real-time Communication** - Implementing WebSockets for messaging

## 💡 **Use Cases**
🔹 **Team Collaboration Tools** - Real-time chat for workplace communication  
🔹 **Live Customer Support** - WebSocket-powered chatbots and live agents  
🔹 **Gaming Chat Systems** - Instant in-game communication for players 🎮  
🔹 **Stock Market & Financial Apps** - Real-time trade updates 📈  

---

## ⚠️ **Limitations & Drawbacks**
❌ **No Ingress Controller** - External traffic routing not implemented  
❌ **No Load Balancing** - Internal service without external access  
❌ **No Cloud Integration** - Runs locally without AWS EKS or cloud hosting  
❌ **Basic WebSocket Implementation** - No authentication or persistent storage  

---

## 🛠 **Future Enhancements**
🔹 Implement **Ingress Controller** for external traffic management 🌐  
🔹 Deploy on **AWS EKS** for a managed Kubernetes experience ☁️  
🔹 Add **Load Balancer** for better traffic distribution ⚖️  
🔹 Enhance security with **Authentication** 🔒
